# FemmParametersForLVDT
 This project aims at helping students with Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDT) modeling. By allowing the user to input the desired parameters for the LDVT and receive a Lua script that can be directly imported in Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) software, the open-source code written for this project will allow for faster prototyping and simulating.   At the current state, the generated executable can only calculate the first quadrant points. In a near future, I hope to complete this project goals by implementing the required Lua generator.
