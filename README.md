# FemmParametersForLVDT
 This project aims at helping students with Linear Variable Differential Transformers (LVDT) modeling. By allowing the user to input the desired parameters for the LDVT and receive a Lua script that can be directly imported in Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) software, the open-source code written for this project will allow for faster prototyping and simulating.   
 
 At this stage, the code can generate a lua script with points, segments and material nodes. There are pieces of soon to be implemented code that will allow for full mesh generation.
